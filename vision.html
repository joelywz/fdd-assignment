    <h1>Vision</h1>
    <p>
      APU Taekwondo believes that developing its member associations is
      critical to its goal of hosting better events and improving the sport at
      grassroots level. Its ambition is to strengthen the support and training
      given to key stakeholders, while sharing best practices in areas such as
      organisation, administration, event management, good governance, gender
      equality, Olympic Values and sustainable development. Another goal is to
      ensure the availability of the tools necessary to work towards quality
      development. To this end, World Taekwondo uses its global membership
      systems, its member association survey and its development programme to
      monitor and support the progression of its members. Administrative
      staff, competition officials, coaches, entourage members and athletes
      are all provided with vital support, including at the end of athletic
      careers.
