			&quot; This student club is amazing! I've met some of my best
			friends from APU Taekwondo Club. I will forever cherish all the
			great memories and unforgettable experiences. Also, Master Lee is
			super passionate about teaching Taekwondo. He genuinely wants us
			to push ourselves every training session to deliver our best
			Taekwondo. Not to mention, Maste Lee is also a 4th Dan Holder in
			Taekwondo! With that said, I highly recommend APU Taekwondo Club
			if you are looking to join. &quot;

			&quot; Being a complete Taekwondo newbie was scary at first. I was
			so afraid that I was going to embarrass myself in training.
			However, the members of APU Taekwondo Club were extremely friendly
			and accomodating to me. They made me feel welcomed, and together
			we had the best moments of our student life !. I even had the
			opportunity to join several external competitions hosted by other
			universities. Glad I chose this club. Trust me! you will not be
			disappointed. &quot;

			&quot; As an international student, I was slightly worried as no
			friends of mine chose APU Taekwondo Club as their student club.
			However, it was to my surprise that this student club has such a
			diverse mixture of domestic and international students, which made
			me feel at ease about the situation. Likewise, social gatherings
			are quite a common occurrence for this club as they like to build
			a sense of camaraderie for its members. For any international
			students thinking about signing up, I suggest you try this club
			out ! &quot;

			&quot; APU Taekwondo Club is one of the most active student clubs
			in APU. Before APU, I was a Taekwondo state athlete that competed
			in various events across Malaysia. By joining this club, I was
			able to pass on my Taekwondo knowledge and training to the club
			members. Also, Master Lee has such vast experience in many aspects
			of Taekwondo that I could refine and improve my Taekwondo
			techniques !. If you are looking to improve physically and
			mentally, I 100&#37; endorse APU Taekwondo Club. &quot;
