        Unfortunately, APU Taekwondo Club is only open for presently enrolled
        APU students only. Past APU students or students from other schools or
        universities cannot register with APU Taekwondo Club.

      <div class="faqAns">
        APU Taekwondo Club does not hold tryouts or auditions for students
        that wish to participate with us. We accept all forms of participants,
        even if you have little to no Taekwondo experience. Hence, newcomers
        can be rest assured that they can take part and keep up with the
        Taekwondo training.

            For newcomers that wish to experience a Taekwondo training
            session, the first two lessons are completely free of charge, with
            no expenses required.<br /><br />
          </li>
          <li>
            For interested students that wish to be a member of APU Taekwondo
            Club, the registration fee is RM 30. The payment is compulsory as
            it contributes to hiring the services of external Taekwondo
            instructors to lead the training sessions.<br /><br />
          </li>
          <li>
            Regarding club fees and event expenses, this will be decided on a

            required payments.

      ><br /><br />
      <div class="faqAns">
        Barring any formal announcements from the Malaysian government, APU
        Taekwondo Club organizes its training sessions every Tuesday and
        Thursday from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., held at the APU Main Campus
        Foyer.

      &#x25BA;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="faqQues"
        >What form of attire should I wear to training ?</span
      ><br /><br />
      <div class="faqAns">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Each APU Taekwondo Club member is encouraged to wear their formal
            training outfit, aka "Dobok", which includes the white jacket,
            white trousers and belt when attending training sessions.<br /><br />
          </li>
          <li>
            For newcomers that do not have a Dobok, students can wear any
            appropriate physical training attire, including a T-shirt, long
            track pants, and sports shoes, when attending training sessions.
            However, if you happen to own a Dobok from your past Taekwondo
            experience, you are more than welcome to wear that attire for the
            training session.

        >Should I eat before training ?</span
      ><br /><br />
      <div class="faqAns">
        We recommend that students consume a high carbohydrate meal 2 hours
        before the training session begins as Taekwondo training requires
        abundant physical output and energy. We also suggest that students
        consume enough water before and during training sessions to prevent
        muscle cramps. Drinks with electrolytes are also highly beneficial for
        this matter.

      <div class="faqAns">
        Students that wish to participate in any outdoor competitions must
        have sufficient Taekwondo training and experience. Additionally, the
        participation of the student must receive approval and confirmation
        from the corresponding Taekwondo instructor. Likewise, all formal
        Taekwondo competitions have their designated registration fees and
        expenses requirement, which must also be paid personally by each
        corresponding participant.

        Yes, we do. Belt examinations will be held if there is an overwhelming

        Students will have the opportunity to improve their Taekwondo rank by

      <div class="faqAns">
        Unfortunately, belt examinations require a panel of invigilators and
        judges to ensure standard Taekwondo examination proceedings are
        carried out appropriately. However, the cost of the belt examination
        can be significantly reduced if there are overwhelming candidates for
        the test. Thus, a belt examination event will only be organized should
        APU Taekwondo Club members make an immense request. Additionally, if a
        student successfully graduates from a belt examination, they will be
        financially responsible for paying for their qualified belt.

      <div class="faqAns">
        1st Dan, also known as First Degree Black Belt, is an auspicious and
        memorable event for many senior-level Taekwondo members. This degree
        demonstrates advanced proficiency and understanding in Taekwondo
        training. With such expertise, the individual may even lead or direct
        a training session. The average time required to get a 1st Dan degree
        is between 3 to 5 years for a complete beginner.
