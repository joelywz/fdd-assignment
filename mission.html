    <h1>Mission</h1>
    <p>
      APU Taekwondo recognises that it has an obligation to work towards the
      growth and success of the wider Olympic Movement. Its policies and
      practices are aligned with those of the International Olympic Committee
      and it continuously works to improve in key areas such as governance and
      social media. The organisation also works hard to promote the IOC's
      Olympic Values of education, inclusiveness, friendship, solidarity and
      fair play. Another key goal is to contribute to a better and more
      peaceful world through sport. One way World Taekwondo does this is
      through its work with the Taekwondo Humanitarian Foundation, which
      teaches the martial art to refugees and displaced people around the
      world. <br />

        opportunity to play, watch and enjoy the sport regardless of age,
        gender, religion, ethnicity or ability.</b
